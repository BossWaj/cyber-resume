            This world is advancing at a rapid pace technology wise. It's important for me as a computer science
            engineer to contribute
            my knowledge and skills to the IT industry. I want to make the world a better place for all of us by finding
            solution to some of our
            biggest problems by developing technological improvements to some of the more traditional methods still used
            in some industries.
            It's important for every industry to adopt new technology to make different aspects of our lives easier by
            interlinking technology with the real world.
            I hope to accomplish this by working at a company such as yours.

              <strong>Epsilon, Banglore - India</strong>
			  <ul>
			     <li>Software Engineer 2 - Mar 2023 to Present</li>
			     <li>Associate Software Engineer - Aug 2021 to Mar 2023</li>
			  </ul>
          </p>
		  <p>
			  <strong>Roles & Responsibilities:</strong>
			  <ul>
			    <li>
				   Aiding clients in their marketing campaigns but writing sql scripts that create the
				   necessary tables with data of various customers who will receive the marketing content
				   as per decision taken by the core AI technology.
			    </li>
				<li>
				   On a day to day basis, I work on different code files written in various languages such as
				   SQL, Batch Scripting, Python etc.
			    </li>
			  </ul>
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  <strong>Projects Worked on Outside My Day to Day Responsibilities:</strong>
			  <ul>
			    <li>
				   Coded an entire python script to convert data pulled from an API into an CSV file which
				   is later fed into an batch script for further processing and finally loades the core tables.
				   Since Snaplogic could not be used effectively for this implementation I was given the
				   opportunity to work on this project and I had successfully implemented the requirements
				   with very quick execution times thanks to multi threading.
			    </li>
				<li>
				   Automated a recursive and once in month process where we had to parse multiple input files
				   and provide the output to the client who were situated in the United States. Since I work
			       in the Indian office, from the time of creation of the ticket to the client getting the parsed
				   files it would take about 24 hours.
				   <p></p>
				   But I was able to write a python automation code that helped the client to run the
				   code and parse the files themselves - This helped save countless hours. The program
                   only took about 5-8 mins to parse 5 files - 200MB each. In this way, I was able improve
				   the efficiency of an existing process followed in our team.
			    </li>
				<li>
				   Automated the code review process to make it quicker and more efficient. we usually compare
				   development and prod code just before promoting latest changes to do this we copy the code
				   from prod to dev environment manually compare it using notepad++ plugins when there are about
				   30 files to compare it becomes extremely cumbersome so I had developed a python code that would
				   automatically loop through the files and compare with respective prod version of the code and the
				   code would also create a differences file (with all the line numbers + content that was changed in
				   each line) and send it to the code review panel.
			    </li>
				<li>
				   Developed python code that pulls data from our databases based on certain business logic and then patches
				   the same to an API. I have implemented threading to make it much more quicker.
				   
				   In each thread we will be patching one set (100 rows each time) of data and like that we will traverse through the extract with
				   millions of records that need to patched to the API.
				   
				   With threading the time to patch data was 10 mins for million records and without threading it was about 20 mins.
